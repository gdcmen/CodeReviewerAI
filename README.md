# AI Assisted Software Testing Tool

Welcome to the AI Assisted Software Testing Tool repository! This tool is designed to help developers analyze their code for syntax errors and receive AI-driven suggestions for improvement.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Tkinter library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
- [G++ compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

You can install the required Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers
```

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-testing-tool.git
cd ai-testing-tool
```

## Usage

1. Run the `Interpreter.py` file to launch the graphical user interface (GUI).
2. Enter your code in the provided text area or load it from a file using the "Load Code from File" button.
3. Click the "Analyze Code" button to perform a syntax check and receive AI recommendations.
4. Save the analyzed code or make necessary corrections based on the provided suggestions.

## Components

### 1. Interpreter

The `Interpreter.py` file contains the GUI implementation using the Tkinter library. It allows users to input code, analyze it, and view the results.

### 2. CodeChecker

The `CodeChecker.py` module includes the `CodeChecker` class responsible for analyzing code for syntax errors and providing AI-driven suggestions. It utilizes the Microsoft CodeReviewer model from the Transformers library.

### 3. FileHandler

The `FileHandler.py` module contains functions for reading code from a file. It is used by the `Interpreter.py` file to load code for analysis.

## Example

```python
# Analyzing code...
# Syntax error: temp.cpp:6:5: error: 'cout' was not declared in this scope; did you mean 'std::cout'?
# AI Suggestion for error at line 6: Review and fix the code based on the reported syntax error.
# AI analysis completed.
# Analysis completed.
```

## Requirements

The AI Assisted Software Testing Tool streamlines code analysis, detecting syntax errors and offering intelligent suggestions for improvement. With an intuitive Tkinter-based interface, it enhances the coding experience by providing quick and actionable insights.
